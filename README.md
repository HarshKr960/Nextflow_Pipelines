**RNA-seq Pipeline (Nextflow DSL2)**

This repository contains a Nextflow DSL2 pipeline for processing RNA-seq paired-end data.
It automates the full workflow from raw FASTQ files to a gene count matrix ready for downstream analysis (e.g., DESeq2, edgeR).

**ðŸ“Œ Workflow Steps**
SetupDirectories â†’ Create output directories (fastqc, trimmed, hisat2, bam, counts).
FastQC â†’ Run quality control on raw FASTQ reads.
Trimmomatic â†’ Adapter removal and quality trimming.
HISAT2 â†’ Alignment of reads to the reference genome.
SamtoolsSort â†’ Convert SAM â†’ BAM and sort alignments.
FeatureCounts â†’ Generate a gene-level count matrix from BAM files.

**Inputs**
  
  Paired-end FASTQ files (*_1.fastq.gz, *_2.fastq.gz)
  
  HISAT2 index (built from reference genome)
  
  GTF annotation file
  
  Adapter file for Trimmomatic

**Outputs**
  
  fastqc/ â†’ Quality reports (.html, .zip)
  
  trimmed/ â†’ Adapter/quality-trimmed reads
  
  hisat2/ â†’ SAM alignment files + HISAT2 mapping stats
 
  bam/ â†’ Sorted BAM files
  
  counts/ â†’ featureCounts.txt (gene counts) + summary
